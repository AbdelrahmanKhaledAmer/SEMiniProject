# SEMiniProject

This is the final draft of the Software Engineering course mini project.

All the files used are in this repository, however the node modules have been excluded.

This is not meant to be a hard-hitting application, nor is it the main course project. It is only meant to test working with a mode-view-controller design pattern with javascript using nodejs and express.

The final product has been deployed on the following url, and will soon be removed as a result of the end of my trial period as a student on AWS services.
